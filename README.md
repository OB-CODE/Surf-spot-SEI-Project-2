## :white_check_mark: Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this

- CSS desing. Knowing this was an area I was not skilled in prior to the project, I made an effort to make it a top priority around responsive design. I am happy with the achievements made, however would love to continue my knwoeldge in this area.
- More API requests.
- Data base merge.
